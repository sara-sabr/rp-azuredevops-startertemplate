## End User Project Configuration Requirements

## Developer Prerequisites

Download and install the following tools

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) (because the VS Code Debugger for Chrome extension [doesn't support iframes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/issues/786) yet)
3. [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (make sure its Node LTS - tested with Node 16)
4. The [Debugger for Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-firefox-debug) VS Code extension
5. The [tfx-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tfx-cli) npm package
6. The [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) npm package
7. The [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) npm package

> If you would prefer not to install the npm packages globally, you can add them to devDependencies in your `package.json` file and invoke them with scripts. You can use the [package.json](./package.json) in this repo as a template for scripts and to ensure you have the correct versions of packages in your extension.
